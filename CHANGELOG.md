- Real-time Redis replication with master synchronization
- Streaming RESP protocol parser and writer
- In-memory storage engine with Redis data type support
- RDB file parsing for initial synchronization
- Comprehensive configuration options using functional options pattern
- Built-in observability with logging and metrics interfaces
- Multiple database support (0-15)
- Key expiration and TTL management
- Memory usage tracking and limits
- Command filtering capabilities
- Graceful shutdown and error recovery
- Complete test suite with >80% coverage

### Features
- **High Performance**: >100k ops/sec throughput with minimal memory overhead
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming parsers prevent excessive memory usage
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and monitoring
- **Redis Compatible**: Works with popular Redis clients like go-redis
- **Flexible Configuration**: Extensive options for timeouts, limits, and behavior
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics collection and structured logging
- **Reliability**: Automatic reconnection and partial sync support
- **Lua Scripting**: Redis-compatible Lua script execution with EVAL/EVALSHA support
- **Data Types**: Support for Redis Lists, Sets, Hashes, and Sorted Sets
- **Security**: SSL/TLS support for secure master connections
- **Filtering**: Advanced command filtering and database selection
- **Persistence**: Snapshot and restore capabilities for data persistence
- **Clustering**: Multi-replica management and chaining support

### API
- `New()` - Create new replica with options
- `Start()` - Begin replication and start local server
- `WaitForSync()` - Wait for initial synchronization completion
- `SyncStatus()` - Get current synchronization status
- `Close()` - Graceful shutdown
- `Storage()` - Direct access to underlying storage
- `OnSyncComplete()` - Register sync completion callbacks

### Examples
- Basic usage example
- Monitoring and observability example  
- Multi-replica cluster example
- Database filtering example
- Lua scripting demonstration
- Pattern matching example
